/**
 * @class Instance
 * @brief Represents a living object (an instance) created from a defined spirit (class).
 *
 * Each Instance carries the "spirit" (its CreationType) that defines
 * its attributes and behavior. Through this, the instance reflects
 * the design of its creation.
 *
 * Example:
 * let there be Human:
 *     create text name = "Adam"
 *     create text wife = "Eve"
 *     create number age = 930
 * amen
 *
 * This would create an Instance of "Human" with the defined attributes.
 *
 * @note The term 'spirit' here parallels the blueprint (class) that animates
 * the instance. Just as the spirit gives life, the class defines the
 * nature of the created object.
 *
 * "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
 * and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
 * and man became a living soul." — Genesis 2:7
