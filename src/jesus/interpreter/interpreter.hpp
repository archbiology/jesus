/**
 * @brief Interprets expressions of the language and evaluates their result.

 * "But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding."
 * ‚Äî Job 32:8
 *
 * This class interprets user-defined expressions and produces runtime values,
 * though true understanding and interpretation come only from God.
 *
 * AST nodes hold structure, Interpreter holds behavior.
 *
 * üåü Why This Helps for Future JIT & Debugging
 *
 *   Want to debug? Wrap the Interpreter::execute() methods with trace logs or breakpoints.
 *   Want to switch to JIT? Swap Interpreter with a JITCompiler.
 *   Want to record execution? Just add hooks in Interpreter.
