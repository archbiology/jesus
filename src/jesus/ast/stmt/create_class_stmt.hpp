/**
 * @brief Represents the 'creation' of a new class in the Jesus language.
 *
 * In the Jesus language, `let there be` is the equivalent of a "class" in other
 * programming languages. It defines a new user-defined type, initially with
 * an empty body, which can later contain attributes and methods.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 *   let there be Person: amen
 * @endcode
 *
 * "God saw all that He had made, and it was very good..." â€” Genesis 1:31
