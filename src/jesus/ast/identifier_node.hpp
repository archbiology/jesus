/**
 * @brief AST node representing an identifier (e.g., variable name).
 *
 * The IdentifierNode holds the name of a symbol used in the program,
 * such as a variable, function, or other named entity. In a complete
 * interpreter or compiler, this node would typically resolve the identifier
 * from a symbol table or environment during execution.
 *
 * Currently, the `execute()` function is a placeholder and does nothing.
 *
 * "The Lord knows those who are his." â€” 2 Timothy 2:19
 * In the same way, each identifier must be identified within the language.
