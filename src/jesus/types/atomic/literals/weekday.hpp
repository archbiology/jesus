 * It represents alignment with the numbers and 'secular' weekday names:
 *  sunday      = lightday  = 1
 *  monday      = skyday    = 2
 *  tuesday     = treeday   = 3
 *  wednesday   = lampday   = 4

 * And God said, "Let there be light,"" and there was light.
 * God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
 * God called the light "day,"" and the darkness he called "night."
 * And there was evening, and there was morningâ€”the first day. â€” Genesis 1:3-5
